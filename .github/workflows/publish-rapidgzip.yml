      # based on the wheel output names in the logs. However, C++17 seems to have introduced some alignment
      # for classes, which results in this error for the GzipReader class itself even without "alignas" being used:

      # to have stopped 2016-12-01 (https://endoflife.date/macos) and even support for 10.14, which was introduced
      # in 2019-09-24 has already stopped in 2021-10-25, so more than a year ago.
